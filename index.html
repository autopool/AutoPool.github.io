<DIV><P>Have a regular carpool with other parents? Know that chore of checking with everyone who&#39;s coming today? Whose turn is it? Not sure if other parents carry their fair share? AutoPool addresses all of these issues, and it really shines with large groups, where administration becomes a nightmare.<br><br>AutoPool is a carpool management utility for groups of families. The group shares a common origin area and a destination, for example, School Rides or Soccer Practice. Invite families or friends you trust, have everyone enter their schedules, and let AutoPool automatically generate the most optimal and fair riding plan.<br><br>AutoPool lets Passengers update their activity times (riding needs) and Drivers update their availability windows. It will continuously analyze all requests, and devise a fair ride plan to satisfy everyone&#39;s needs in the most optimal way. Furthermore, AutoPool automatically informs all affected parties whenever a change to their rides occurs. Passengers in the group can easily see who&#39;s picking them up and when, and Drivers can check when their next ride is, and who&#39;s included.<br><br>As a driver in a carpool, you can further configure the number of available seats in your car, and describe how it looks - for easy identification. In addition, for large groups, you can prioritize your passenger list (i.e. which passengers live closest to you and make the most sense for you to pick up).<br><br>Carpool Administrators can set up family relations between members. When a family is set:<br>    1. Its passengers will get higher priority to drive with their parents.<br>    2. Parents get notified about ride changes affecting their kids.<br>    3. Family members are allowed to make configuration changes to each other.<br>    4. Ride balance points are counted towards the family, no matter which parent made the drive.<br><br></P>
